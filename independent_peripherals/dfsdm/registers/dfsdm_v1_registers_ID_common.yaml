# This file is an (incomplete) example of having different registers
# in one file. This makes sense when these registers always show up
# together (RM0436, RM0441, RM0442 for these ID regs) and don't have a
# lot of variations. Their fields can also all go in one file
# (fields/dfsdm_v1_fields_ID_common.yaml).
