# CRC peripheral. Details specifically from RM0090 but widely applicable.
# This covers the basic features - DR and CR. For the more sophisticated
# CRC available on some STM32s, use crc_advanced.yaml.
# Additionally use crc_idr_8bit.yaml or crc_idr_32bit.yaml as appropriate.

CRC:
  DR:
    DR: [0, 4294967295]
  CR:

      _write:
        Reset: [1, "Resets the CRC calculation unit and sets the data register to 0xFFFF FFFF"]
