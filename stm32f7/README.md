# stm32f7
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to STM32F7 peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.stm32f7]
version = "0.6.0"
features = ["stm32f7x2", "rt"]
```

The `rt` feature is optional and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.

In your code:

```rust
extern crate stm32f7;
use stm32f7::stm32f7x2;

let mut peripherals = stm32f7x2::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpioa = &peripherals.GPIOA;
gpioa.odr.modify(|_, w| w.odr0().set_bit());
```
