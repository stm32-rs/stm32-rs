# STM32 Crates

_formerly [adamgreig/stm32-rs](https://github.com/adamgreig/stm32-rs)_

This repository contains device support for all STM32 microcontrollers,
providing a safe API to that device using [svd2rust] and an extensive hierarchy
of SVD patches. Each supported device is a feature-gated module in a crate for
that device family.

[svd2rust]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust

**Please note many parts of most libraries will not have been tested on every
possible chip yet! While they're all generated from ST-provided SVD files,
we can't make any guarantee of correctness. Please report any bugs you find!**

You can see current coverage status for each chip
[here](https://stm32.agg.io/rs). Coverage means that individual fields are
documented with possible values, but even devices with low coverage should
have every register and field available in the API. That page also allows you
to drill down into each field on each register on each peripheral.

## Using Device Crates In Your Own Project

In your own project's `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies.stm32f4]
version = "0.7.0"
features = ["stm32f405", "rt"]
```
The `rt` feature is optional but helpful. See
[svd2rust](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/0.12.0/svd2rust/#the-rt-feature) for
details.

Then, in your code:

```rust
use stm32f4::stm32f405;

let mut peripherals = stm32f405::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
```

Refer to `svd2rust` [documentation](https://docs.rs/svd2rust) for further usage.

Replace `stm32f4` and `stm32f405` with your own device; see the individual
crate READMEs for the complete list of supported devices. All current STM32
devices should be supported to some level.

## Generating Device Crates / Building Locally

* Install `svd2rust`: `cargo install svd2rust`
* Install `form`: `cargo install form`
* Install rustfmt: `rustup component add rustfmt`
* Install PyYAML: `pip install --user pyyaml`
* Unzip bundled SVD zip files: `cd svd; ./extract.sh`
* Generate patched SVD files: `cd ..; make patch`
* Generate svd2rust device crates: `make svd2rust` (you probably want `-j` for this)
* Optional: Format device crates: `make form` (you probably want `-j` for this)

## Motivation and Objectives

This project serves two purposes:

* Create a source of high-quality STM32 SVD files, with manufacturer errors
  and inconsistencies fixed. These files could be used with svd2rust or other
  tools, or in other projects. They should hopefully be useful in their own
  right.
* Create and publish svd2rust-generated crates covering all STM32s, using
  the SVD files.

At present many individual crates exist for specific STM32 devices, typically
maintained by many separate users with hand-edited updates to the SVD files.
This means that support for less-common STM32s is completely missing, and
the hand-edited SVDs may be inconsistent with other crates. Plus, it's a huge
duplication of work, since so many peripherals are the same between devices.

This project hopes to reduce the duplication of effort, and hopefully in the
future enable further automation / code generation based on automatically
identifying similarities between different devices.

## Helping

This project is still young and there's a lot to do!

* More peripheral patches need to be written, most of all. See what we've got
  in `peripherals/` and grab a reference manual!
* Also everything needs testing, and you can't so easily automate finding bugs
  in the SVD files...
* Is this really the best way to support a lot of devices? We end up with a
  handful of crates, each with a lot of features, and each feature enables a
  gigantic module, but they all share a lot of code. Can we automatically
  factor out the shared structures?

Please see the individual crate READMEs for the full list of devices each crate
supports. All SVDs released by ST for STM32 devices are covered, so probably
your device is supported to some extent!

**Devices that are nearly identical, like the STM32F405/F415, are supported by
ST under a single SVD file STM32F405, so if you can't find your exact device
check if its sibling is supported instead.**

Many peripherals are not yet patched to provide the type-safe friendly-name
interface; please consider helping out with this!

Check out the full list of supported devices [here](https://stm32.agg.io/rs).

## Adding New Devices

* Update SVD zips in `svd/vendor` to include new SVD.
* Run `svd/extract.sh` to extract the zips into `svd` (ignored in git).
* Add new YAML file in `devices/` with the new SVD path and include any
  required SVD patches for this device, such as renaming or merging fields.
* You can run `scripts/matchperipherals.py` script to find out what existing
  peripherals could be cleanly applied to this new SVD. If they look sensible,
  you can include them in your device YAML.
* Re-run `scripts/makecrates.py devices/` to update the crates with the new devices.
* Run `make` to rebuild, which will make a patched SVD and then run `svd2rust`
  on it to generate the final library.

## Updating Existing Devices/Peripherals

* You'll need to run `svd/extract.sh` at least once to pull the SVDs out.
* Edit the device or peripheral YAML (see below for format).
* Run `make` to rebuild all the crates using `svdpatch.py` and `svd2rust`.
* Test your new stuff compiles: `cd stm32f4; cargo build --features stm32f405`

If you've added a new peripheral, consider using the `matchperipherals.py`
script to see which devices it would cleanly apply to.

To generate a new peripheral file from scratch, consider using
`periphtemplate.py`, which creates an empty peripheral file based on a single
SVD file, with registers and fields ready to be populated. For single bit wide
fields with names ending in 'E' or 'D' it additionally generates sample
"Enabled"/"Disabled" entries to save time.

## Device and Peripheral YAML Format

The patch specifications are in YAML and have the following general format:

```yaml
# Path to the SVD file we're targeting. Relative to this file.
# This must be included only in the device YAML file.
_svd: "../svd/STM32F0x0.svd"

# Include other YAML files. Path relative to this file.
_include:
    - "../peripherals/gpio_v2.yaml"

```

### Name Matching
Peripheral, register, and field names can be specified:
* Directly
* Using `?` and `*` for single- and multi- character wildcards
* Using `[ABC]` to give a list of possible matching characters
* Using commas to separate a list of possible matches

You must quote the name if using any special characters in YAML.

### Style Guide

* Enumerated values should be named in the past tense ("enabled", "masked",
  etc).
* Descriptions should start with capital letters but do not end with a period
