# Changelog

## Unreleased

* svdpatch.py - added functionality to delete all interrupts from a device level delete
  ```
  _delete:
    - _interrupts
  ```
* svdpatch.py - changed behaviour to allow adding interrupts to perpherals that are derivedFrom another peripheral
* F411 - deleted all interrupts and added a complete list of correct interrupts

## v 0.6.0 2019-01-14

Family-specific:

* F0: Extensively updated, RCC (#118, #130, #131), SYSCFG/COMP (#124), ADC (#129), SPI (#135)
* F1: Update RCC (#130)
* F2: RCC (#139)
* F4: USB OTG updated (#127), RCC (#130, #137)
* F7: RCC (#130, #137)
* L0: Fix wakeup pin bits in PWR_CSR (#120)
* G0: Introduced with basic support (#123)

Common:
* SPI: Added SSI, RXCRC, TXCRC (#138)
* We standardised on `Div8` style dividers, instead of `DIV8` or `DIV_8`.
* Travis builds now much faster (#134)
* Documentation links updated (#128)

## v 0.5.0 2018-12-16
* Now built on stable Rust
* Updated to svd2rust 0.14.0 (#108)
* Added patch support for rebasing peripherals (#98)
* Added patch support for arrays (#107)
* Added patch support for clusters (#112)

### Breaking Changes
* F0: Various fixes to RCC (#99, #114)
* F103: A few USB updates (#111)
* F103: Define a number of arrays and clusters (#112)
* F4: Various fixes to RCC (#95, #102)
* F4: Corrected UART Stop2 value (#103)
* L4: Various fixes to RCC (#101)
* L4: Fix USBFSEN (#92), other USB changes (#94)
* TIM: Various fixes (#96)

## v 0.4.0 2018-11-13
* F7: Ethernet peripheral updates
* F0: ADC CFGR2 JITOFF_D* renamed CKMODE (#77)
* F4: Missing RCC enable/reset bits for various peripherals (#80)
* USART updated for most families (#75)
* F4: Ethernet peripheral updates (#81, #87)
* F4: RCC updates (#83)

## v 0.3.2 2018-10-07
* F4: Update ethernet peripheral across entire family (#71, #73)

### Breaking Changes
* F4 ethernet MACMIIDR field TD is renamed MD to align with the reference
  manual

## v 0.3.1 fe63529 2018-10-07
* Fix typo in `tim16.yaml` that prevents builds on most devices

## v 0.3.0 241ca45 2018-10-07
* H7x3: Add ETHERNET peripheral from scratch (#42)
* F0 and F1: GPIO updated (#49)
* F0: RCC updated (#58)
* L1: GPIO updated (#54)
* IWDG added for most devices (#45, #64)
* WWDG added for most devices (#48, #68)
* CRC added or updated for most devices (#46)
* Timers added or updated for most devices (#57)
* DMA added for most devices (#62)
* I2C added for most devices (#65)
* Supports Rust 1.30-beta for 2018 edition

### Breaking Changes
* Most I2C peripherals have their `SADDx`, `OA1x`, or `ADDx` registers merged
  into a single `SADD`, `OA1`, or `ADD` register. 7-bit addresses will need
  to be written shifted left by 1, i.e., in 8-bit mode.
