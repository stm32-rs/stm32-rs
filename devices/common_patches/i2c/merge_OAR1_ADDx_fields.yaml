# Merge together I2C OAR1 wrongly separated ADDx fields
#
# Some devices have ADD_0 ADD_1_7 and ADD_8_9 so they need to be renamed before merging.
# Some devices have ADD0 ADD7 ADD10 (example F4 family)
#
# We can't use ADD* to merge the fields because the register has an ADDMODE
# field and I haven't find a way to merge ADD0, ADD7, ADD10 so I rename ADD10
# to ADD9 as a workaround.
