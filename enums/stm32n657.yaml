It is useful to start several timers at the same time or to control a window in which a slave timer is enabled. The Counter Enable signal is generated by a logic AND between the CEN control bit and the trigger input when configured in Gated mode. When the Counter Enable signal is controlled by the trigger input, there is a delay on tim_trgo2, except if the Master/Slave mode is selected (see the MSM bit description in TIMx_SMCR register)."

        - CC1 behaves normally depending on counter and CCR1 values even when the trigger is ON. The minimum delay to activate CC1 output when an edge occurs on the trigger input is 5 clock cycles.

        - An active edge on the trigger input acts like a compare match on CC1 output. OC is then set to the compare level independently of the result of the comparison.
