# This file is a complete implementation of all of the fields and
# variations for the CHyCFGR1 register across all devices. Note that
# the enums/ranges are included in the field descriptions instead of
# in peripherals/ in a separate file. Also note that DATMPX has two
# versions with slightly different enums. The same approach would work
# for fields with slightly different bitOffsets or bitWidths. Each
# field variation gets a descriptive key (DATMPX_ADC vs. DATMPX_NOADC)
# that is pulled into the relevant register variations in
# registers/dfsdm_v1_registers_CHyCFGR1.yaml.
