# Not implemented yet, but this is an example where an occasionally RM
# differentiates between two sets of chips for the given peripheral
# (see the two tables on page 831). To deal with this, just give this
# file a more descriptive name and treat it as a separate RM. I did
# not make a file for L4P5xx/L4Q5xx to reduce clutter, but there
# should be one for those chips as well.
